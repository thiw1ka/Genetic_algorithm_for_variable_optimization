# Genetic_algorithm_for_variable_optimization
The genetic algorthm is one of the first optimization algorithem introduces in 1975 based on natural evolution. It optimizes values based on survival of the fittest and achive the optimized values in less number of iteration than brute force method. Genetic algorithm is useful when a system model is not available which also refers to a black box.
